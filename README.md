# Micro Front End Experiment

## Description

The micro frontends experiment is a study initiative among friends and aims to test the technique through an application built on fragments that use different technologies.

For this experiment we will use an orchestrator with Single SPA that will build a record store using the fragments list of records (angled), checkout (react), scrapbook (vuejs) and wish list (svelte).

The mock of the project is using json-server.

## How to start using?

Installing the dependencies: `yarn install`

Starting the server at `localhost: 8080`:` yarn watch`

Application build: `yarn build`
